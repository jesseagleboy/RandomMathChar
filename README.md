# RandomMathChar

There _really_ isn't much to this.
There were a couple of small goals for this random project:
  1. Find the lowest common multiple of range(1, 10)
  1. Find what other numbers in range (i, **LCM**) were also divisible by the **LCM**.
  1. Convert each divisble number to it's char value.
  1. Repeat the string of each char value the number of times of the value that was divisble by the **LCM**.
  1. Initialize a git repository and push it to GitHub.
  
 Once again, there isn't much to it besides being a random project for me but I hope you like it!
